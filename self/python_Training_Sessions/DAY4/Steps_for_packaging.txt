STEP1: CREATE below 
mkdir packaging 
cd  packaging
mkdir flaskr
echo > flaskr\__init__.py
move  ..\quick_server.py flaskr\
move   ..\templates flaskr
move   ..\static flaskr
echo > setup.py 
echo > MANIFEST.in

STEP2: UPDATE
#__init__.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
from . import quick_server
#Update quick_server.py
from flask import Flask 
#app = Flask(__name__)
from flaskr import app
#setup.py
from setuptools import find_packages, setup
setup(
    name='flaskr',
    version='1.0.0',
    #Please keep in mind that you have to list subpackages explicitly. 
    #If you want setuptools to lookup the packages for you automatically
    #which py pkg to package, based on current dir 
    packages=find_packages(),
    include_package_data=True,  # checks  MANIFEST.in
    zip_safe=False, #setuptools to install your project as a directory rather than as a zipfile
    install_requires=[
        'flask',
    ],
)
#MANIFEST.in
graft flaskr/templates
global-exclude *.pyc
graft flaskr/static

------------Further help:
Note include any other directory by 
graft flaskr/static

Include any file 
include flaskr/example.json


$ pip install wheel
$ python setup.py bdist_wheel
#You can find the file in dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

STEP3: Take this file to any machine 
Get the ip of the machine by 'ipconfig', Note it down as HOST_IP 


Install 
$ pip install --force-reinstall --no-dependencies dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl

STEP4:
##Deployement
#https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/

# For example to deploy via  Gevent 
pip install gevent 
#Gevent is a coroutine-based Python networking library 
#that uses greenlet to provide a high-level synchronous API on top of libev event loop:


#gevent_server.py
from gevent.pywsgi import WSGIServer
from flaskr import app

# http_server = WSGIServer(('localhost', 443), app, keyfile='key.pem', certfile='cert.pem')
http_server = WSGIServer(('localhost', 80), app)
http_server.serve_forever()

##To generate self signed certificate 
Note cert.pem may have public ip or localhost 
But whatever it has , must be the same as given in above 'http_server'

import requests
r = requests.get("https://localhost/helloj?name=das&format=json", verify=False)
r = requests.get("https://localhost/helloj?name=das&format=json", verify="./cert.pem")

#Create - instead of localhost, gives public IP 
#-nodes (short for no DES) for no  passphrase(else min 4 character passphrase) 
(check by 'where openssl.exe' ) 
$ openssl req -x509 -subj '/CN=localhost' -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
