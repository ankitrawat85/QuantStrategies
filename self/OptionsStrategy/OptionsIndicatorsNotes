The exponential version (EMA) gives greater weight to the more recent prices than it does to the older prices. In this way it reacts to price changes faster. Traders use 9-, 12-, and 26-day EMAs most often to trade from. Remember that the latter two are also used to create the MACD indicator. To me, if you want the moving average to react faster, then you should just use a shorter time period for your calculation on an SMA rather than using an EMA.
RSI to move above 60 to confirm a bullish trend and under 40 for a bearish one.

a bullish crossover happens when the MACD crosses above
 the signal line and a bearish crossover happens
when the MACD crosses below the signal line.
 A cross up is a buy and a cross down is a sell.

 # RSI --
Different time units such as monthly,weekly, daily, 60-minute, 30-minute and 5-minute bars.
When day trading, there are three dominant timeframes that have a crucial influence: the big timeframe (daily chart),
the intermediate timeframe (30-minute chart), and the short­ term timeframe (5-minute chart).
When position trading, the three dominant timeframes are daily, weekly and monthly.

In this example, if we were I -minute timeframe traders using the I 5-minute chart for confirmation, we would be able to find multiple entry points on the I-minute chart on the right.
The I5-minute chart on the left serves as a trend confirmation tool.
Rule #1
 In an uptrend, the RSI finds resistance at 80 and support at 40.
2. In a downtrend, the RSI finds resistance at 60 and support at 20.
sing the 80/40 and 60/20 range rules, we can instantly identify the trend the majority of the time. If the RSI is staying within the 80/40 ranges, we know that the trend is up, and the majority of the "other" traders are also looking at this same time frame.
If the RSI is staying within the 60/20 ranges, we know that the Bears are in control and the trend is down.
