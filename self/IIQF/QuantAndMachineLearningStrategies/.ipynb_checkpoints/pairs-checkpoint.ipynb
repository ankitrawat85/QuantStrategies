    "## Pairs Trading Strategies Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to making money in the stock market, there are a myriad of different ways to make money. And it seems that in the finance community, everywhere you go, people are telling you that you should learn Python. After all, Python is a popular programming language which can be used in all types of fields, including data science. There are a large number of packages that can help you meet your goals, and many companies use Python for development of data-centric applications and scientific computation, which is associated with the financial world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of all Python can help us utilize many different trading strategies that (without it) would by very difficult to analyze by hand or with spreadsheets. One of the trading strategies we will talk about is referred to as **Pairs Trading.**"

An example might be two companies that manufacture the same product, or two companies in one supply chain. If we can model this economic link with a mathematical model, we can make trades on it.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using more securities and more varied time ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "For the pairs trading strategy cointegration test, I only used a handful of stocks. Naturally (and in practice) it would be more effective to use clusters within an industry. I only use the time range of only 5 years, which may not be representative of stock market volatility.\n",

    "#### 2. Dealing with overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything related to data analysis and training models has much to do with the problem of overfitting. There are many different ways to deal with overfitting like validation, such as Kalman filters, and other statistical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Adjusting the trading signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our trading algorithm fails to account for stock prices that overlap and cross each other. Considering that the code only calls for a buy or sell given its ratio, it doesn't take into account which stock is actually higher or lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. More advanced methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with algorithmic pairs trading. It's simple because it only deals with moving averages and ratios. If you want to use more complicated statistics, feel free to do so. Other complex examples include subjects such as the Hurst exponent, half-life mean reversion, and Kalman Filters."
